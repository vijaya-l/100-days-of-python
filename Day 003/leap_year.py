# on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
#  **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100
#    **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

# e.g. The year 2000:
# 2000 ÷ 4 = 500 (Leap)
# 2000 ÷ 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
# 2000 ÷ 400 = 5 (Leap!)
# So the year 2000 is a leap year.

# But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:
# 2100 ÷ 4 = 525 (Leap)
# 2100 ÷ 100 = 21 (Not Leap)
# 2100 ÷ 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)

year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
